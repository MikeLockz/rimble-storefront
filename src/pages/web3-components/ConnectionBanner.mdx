# Connection Banner

React component built with [Rimble UI](https://github.com/ConsenSys/rimble-ui) that displays a banner providing information about a user's Ethereum network connection. The banner will give informative and helpful information to resolve the issue with device-specific language. The banner informs the user of the following scenarios:

- not using a Web3-capable browser
- a wallet is not available
- current Ethereum network does not match the specified required network

## Installation

Install the package in your project directory with:

```sh
// with npm
npm install @rimble/connection-banner

// with yarn
yarn add @rimble/connection-banner
```

## Usage Example

**Default messages**

```js is=react-live
<ConnectionBanner
  currentNetwork={3}
  requiredNetwork={1}
  onWeb3Fallback={true}
/>;
```

**Custom messages**

```js is=react-live
<ConnectionBanner
  currentNetwork={4}
  requiredNetwork={1}
  onWeb3Fallback={true}
>
  {{
    notWeb3CapableBrowserMessage: (
      <div>
        <p>Not a web3 capable browser</p>
      </div>
    ),
    noNetworkAvailableMessage: (
      <div>
        <p>No Ethereum network available</p>
      </div>
    ),
    onWrongNetworkMessage: (
      <div>
        <p>On wrong Ethereum network</p>
      </div>
    ),
  }}
</ConnectionBanner>
```

**onWrongNetworkMessage - Desktop**

> Switch to the `requiredNetworkName` Ethereum network in MetaMask
>
> Change your network in your MetaMask extension. You're currently on `currentNetworkName`

**onWrongNetworkMessage - Mobile**

> Switch to the `requiredNetworkName` Ethereum network in Settings
>
> Change your network in your MetaMask extension. You're currently on `currentNetworkName`

## Design guidelines

**The connection banner helps users get on the right Ethereum network to use your dApp. It doesn't prevent them from interacting with your dApp's non-blockchain features.**

Your content needs to instruct the user how to get to the right network, but a user can be at different levels of readiness.

1. On a network, but on the wrong one
2. Without a Web 3 provider
3. On a browser that won't support a Web 3 provider

Your content should explain how to overcome each step.

1. How to switch to the right network
2. How to get on a Web 3 provider
3. Which browser to use instead

At the stage a user will see this component, they are just browsing and not attempting any blockchain functionality. So you should allow them to browse freely but explain that if they want to use some blockchain features they should follow the instructions in the banner based on their current situation.

**Principles**

- **One thing at a time:** if the user is using Safari, they're going to have to go through multiple steps to start using your dApp (changing browser and downloading MetaMask) however once they've done the first step (changed browser) there's another banner helping them to install MetaMask. This means you don't need to mention this in the wrong browser banner. Just keep your instruction clear and simple to follow and let the next banner explain the next step.
- **Avoid connection:** it can be detecting to describe this process as connecting to a different network. However we've found that this can cause confusion with connecting to the dApp. Plus, if you're using a Web3 provider, you'll automatically be on a network without having gone through the act of deliberately connecting. We like "Switch to" a different network as it reflects the simple process that it is.
- **Keep it passive:** it's not urgent that the user should follow your instructions just yet. So make it clear when they should bother changing network, e.g. to use your blockchain features
- **Tell them where:** because you aren't able to change network from a dApp, you should be as descriptive as you can in terms of where to change the network. This has its challenges as it can differ between products. "Settings" seems to be a safe term for Mobile, whereas you should use "MetaMask" on desktop.


**Core information**

*Our components can be customised so you can add your own dApps voice and tone, but what should you make sure you retain?*

**The current network:** users can use this as a way to navigate the wallet or MetaMask UI and find where to change their network

**Alternatives:** when it comes to browsers, let them know the ones they can use

**The reason:** this is a passive banner, let them know in what contexts they should follow the instruction

**Tips**

*Our advice if you want to re-write*

**Keep it active**

Make sure your banner copy is clear and inspires action

  {{
    positive: (
    <Text>Switch to the Rinkeby network</Text>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Text>The correct network was not detected</Text>
    ),
  }}
</DoDont>

**Avoid Web3 jargon**

Technically, the functionality in this component tries to detect a Web 3 provider. However, users don't need to know this.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
    <Text>Switch browsers to use our blockchain features</Text>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Text>No web3 detected</Text>
    ),
  }}
