# QR design guidelines

Turn public addresses or links into QR codes that your users can scan instead of copy/pasting.

## Design

Some best practice for using `QR` in your product.

### Explain what it is

Let your user know what the QR code represents and what will happen once they scan the QR code. Don't just assume your user is familiar with the pattern of QR codes being used for public addresses.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Box>
        <Heading.h5>Your connected account:</Heading.h5>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
      </Box>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Box textAlign={'center'}>
      <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
    </Box>
    ),
  }}
</DoDont>

### Provide an alternative

If you're using a QR code to represent a public address, always give the user the ability to copy/paste the address manually too. They may not want to grant your dApp access to their camera or they may be at a desktop set-up where scanning QR codes is inconvenient.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Box>
        <Heading.h5>Your connected account:</Heading.h5>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
        <PublicAddress
              required="false"
              address="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A"
            />
      </Box>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Box textAlign={'center'}>
      <Heading.h5>Your connected account</Heading.h5>
      <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
    </Box>
    ),
  }}
</DoDont>
