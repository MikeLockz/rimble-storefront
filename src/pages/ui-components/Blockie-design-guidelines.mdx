# Blockie design guidelines

Use the `Blockie` component to give users a visual representation of their Ethereum public address.

## Design

Some best practice for using `Blockie` in your product.

### Don't make blockies circular

This obscures some of the blockie, making it more difficult for users to visually identify their Ethereum address. This means they're not a good idea to use in place of avatars.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
    <Blockie
            opts={{
              seed: 'foo',
              color: '#dfe',
              bgcolor: '#a71',
              size: 15,
              scale: 3,
              spotcolor: '#000',
            }}
          />
    ),
    negative: (
    <Avatar
            mb={3}
            size="medium"
            src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6E2bK3gagTUHroxhDsDP1w.jpeg"
          />
    ),
  }}
</DoDont>

## Research

We have some anecdotal evidence that blockies are not effectively helping users of Ethereum wallets or dApps as they are being implemented in many cases. We have chosen to include the pattern in Rimble because of its broad adoption and lack of alternatives. However, we believe further research, better usage guidelines, and potentially alternative patterns are needed.
