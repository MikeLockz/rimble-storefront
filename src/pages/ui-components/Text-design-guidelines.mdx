# Text design guidelines

Use the Text component for copy. Remember to keep your writing as simple as possible, particularly in the blockchain world. Also, bear in mind users are prone to scanning content, so use small chunks of text broken up by headings to make your text more useful.

## Design

Some best practices for using `Text`.

### Don't center-align your text if it's over 3 lines

Centre-aligned text can make it more difficult to read.

    positive: (
    <Text>
      The intent of Ethereum is to create an alternative protocol for building decentralized applications, providing a different set of tradeoffs that we believe will be very useful for a large class of decentralized applications, with particular emphasis on situations where rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important.
    </Text>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Text textAlign="center">

### Use `Heading` to break up long copy

Use the [`Heading`](/Develop/Heading) component to break up text and make it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
    <Box>
    <Heading.h4>
      The intent of Ethereum
    </Heading.h4>
    <Text>

    </Text>
    <Heading.h4>
      Where is Ethereum most important?
    </Heading.h4>
    <Text>
      Ethereum is particularly important for building decentralized applications with particular emphasis on rapid development time, security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of different applications to very efficiently interact, are important.

### Aim for a low reading age

Make it easier for your users to read your copy. The lower the reading age, the simpler it will be for them to consume your information. [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) makes it easier to simplify your writing.
<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
    <Text>Write in short sentences and avoid complex terms when there are simpler alternatives.</Text>
    ),
    negative: (
    <Text>Use jargon, technical language or complex sentence structures.
    </Text>
    ),
  }}
