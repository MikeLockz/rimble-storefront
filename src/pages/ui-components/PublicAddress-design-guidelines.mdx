# PublicAddress design guidelines

Use `PublicAddress` to displaying an Ethereum address. It can be used for a wallet address, reference to a specific blockchain entry or a contract address.

## Design

Some best practice for using `PublicAddress`

### Consider showing a QR code too

Although the copy-to-clipboard functionality makes it relatively easy to do stuff with a public address, you may want to consider showing a QR code of the address so that users can interact with the address using a mobile wallet or dApp.

<Card mx={'auto'} my={3} px={4}>
<Heading.h5>Your connected account:</Heading.h5>
<QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
<br />
<br />
<PublicAddress
required="false"
address="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A"
/>
</Card>
