# Heading design guidelines

Use the `Heading` component to give users scannable titles on your interface. A user should be able to understand what a page is for just by reading the headings. This components extends the [`Text`](/Develop/Text) component to provide default heading styles for H1-H6.

## Design

Some best practices for using `Heading` in your product.

- Only use one `h1` per page
- Headings should explain the content below
- Keep headings short for scannability
- Headings should appear at the top of the section of the interface they're introducing

## Content

Some best practices for writing `Heading` components.

### Avoid articles to keep headings succinct

Don’t use articles (a, the, an) in headings. This will make them shorter and quicker to scan.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Heading.h2>Add wallet</Heading.h2>
    ),
    negative: (
      <Heading.h2>Add a wallet</Heading.h2>
    ),
  }}
</DoDont>
