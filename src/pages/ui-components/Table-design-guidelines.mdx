# Table design guidelines

Use a `table` component so your users can easily scan and compare data in your product. They are not for layout.

## Design and content

Some best practice for using `Table`

### Only use tables for data

Data tables are more screen reader-friendly. Screen readers will identify the number of columns and rows, plus they'll read column and row headers. Layout tables are just read in source code order, which can create serious confusion for those using screen readers. For more explanation, [read about accessible tables.](https://webaim.org/techniques/tables/)

### Consider more responsive options

Tables are hard to read and navigate on mobile devices, especially if there are lots of columns. Consider whether your information really needs to be presented in a table before committing to one.

### Wrap, don't truncate

Truncation prevents users from comparing data accurately. For example, if all data in a particular column starts with the same word, they'll all appear the same unless wrapped.

### More rows than columns is easier to read

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
        <Table>
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th>1</th>
              <th>2</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>1st</td>
              <td>row</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>2nd</td>
              <td>row</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>3rd</td>
              <td>row</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </Table>
        ),
        negative: (
<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <th>2</th>
      <th>3</th>
      <th>4</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1st</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>w</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2nd</td>
      <td>r</td>
      <td>o</td>
      <td>w</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>
),
}}
</DoDont>

### Headings should summarise the data within each column

Make sure your headings are clear and give the user enough information about what to expect in the data that follows.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Currency</th>
            <th>Value change</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>ETH</td>
            <td>Up 10%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>BTC</td>
            <td>Up 8%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DAI</td>
            <td>Up 2%</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </Table>
    ),
    negative: (
      <Table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>$</th>
            <th>%</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>ETH</td>
            <td>Up 10%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>BTC</td>
            <td>Up 8%</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>DAI</td>
            <td>Up 2%</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </Table>
    ),
  }}
