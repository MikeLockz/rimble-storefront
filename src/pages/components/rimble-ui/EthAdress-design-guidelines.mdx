# EthAddress design guidelines

Use the `EthAddress` when you need to show an Ethereum address to the user for display purposes only. If you're looking for something with copy-to-clipboard functionality, use [`PublicAddress`](/Develop/PublicAddress) instead.

## When to use each variation

### Full address

When you need the user to confirm an address. This will allow them to double check it more accurately and increase confidence in their transaction.

**Example scenarios**

<Card>
  <Heading.h3>Confirm payment</Heading.h3>
  <Text>Are you sure you want to send 1 ETH to</Text>
  <Flex>
    <Box mr={4}>
      <Blockie
        opts={{
          seed: "0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A"
        }}
      />
    </Box>
    <Box justifyContent="center" alignItems="center">
      <Text ml={4}>0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A </Text>
    </Box>
  </Flex>
  <Button mt={4} mr={3}>
    Send ETH
  </Button>
  <Button.Text>Cancel</Button.Text>
</Card>

### Truncated address

When the address acts more like meta data in your product. Like when you want to show a connected state or provide supporting information about a past transaction.

**Example scenarios**

<Table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Transaction hash</th>
      <th>From</th>
      <th>To</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>0x34ab...ddb8</td>
      <td>0xAc03...1e5A</td>
      <td>0xa7ae...6f03</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</Table>

## Design

Some best practice for using `EthAddress` in your product.

### Only show an address when necessary

You can search any public address in Etherscan and get a complete list of all past transactions for that address as well as the value of that account. If your dApp doesn't need you to publicly display your user's public addresses for all to see, it's probably safer for them if you don't.

### Display with a label

Label an Ethereum address appropriately. Is it the address of your account or somebody else's? Or is just a transaction hash?

## Research

### Users may not trust truncation

Public addresses can make new users nervous when transacting, so consider carefully when to use truncation. Research has shown that some inexperienced dApp users will copy and paste a truncated address into a new tab's URL bar to double check the address matches their wallet address.

Full disclosure: this research was for blockchain news platform, Civil.

### Those same users were less careful about other's addresses

This behaviour wasn't repeated when the users were asked to send ETH to another wallet. They were keen to check the entire string of their own address, but would happily interact with a recipient's truncated address. Bear this in mind when deciding which addresses to truncate and which ones to display in full.
