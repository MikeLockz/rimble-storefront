# ToastMessage

Use toast messages to provide updates about a process. The `ToastMessage` component extends [Box](/components/rimble-ui/Box).

*Want to find out about the provider?* Read [ToastMessage.provider documentation](/components/rimble-ui/ToastMessage-provider)

**Import component**

```
import { ToastMessage } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Examples

Different ways to use the `ToastMessage` component.

**Standard toast**

For when you want to just provide a quick process update like a confirmation.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"Transaction started"} />
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"0xAc0...e5A connected"} colorTheme={"dark"} my={3} />
```

**Standard toast with subtitle**

For when you want to provide more value through extra helpful information. Ask yourself when implementing your toast: is there anything else I could tell the user that would be useful?

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Transaction complete"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 4.20 ETH remaining"}
  my={3}
/>
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Switched network"}
  secondaryMessage={"You are now on Rinkeby"}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
  my={3}
/>
```

**Icon**

When you want to reinforce your message with a visual.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"Welcome to my dApp"} icon={"Mood"} my={3} />
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Welcome to my dApp"}
  icon={"Mood"}
  my={3}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
/>
```

**Link**

When your Toast message has a link to support it. Note: this link should only take users to optional, supporting info.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Transaction started"}
  secondaryMessage={"Check on its progress using Etherscan"}
  my={3}
  actionText={"Check"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
/>
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Write update here [Required]"}
  secondaryMessage={"Supporting information for update [Optional]"}
  icon={"InfoOutline"}
  my={3}
  actionText={"Link"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
/>
```

**Process toasts**

---

Ready-made messages to help users understand what's happening with a process they initiate, like a transaction.

**Processing**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Processing my={3} message={"Processing 0.00018 ETH payment"} />
```

**Success**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Success
  my={3}
  message={"ETH sent"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 1.03 Ether (ETH) remaining"}
/>
```

**Failure**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Failure
  my={3}
  message={"Payment failed"}
  secondaryMessage={"You don't have enough Ether (ETH)"}
  actionText={"Buy ETH"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
/>
```

## Component props

`ToastMessage` will pass any props that are defined on its component and uses the following:

## Styled-system props

`ToastMessage` uses all the style props from [`Box`](/components/rimble-ui/Box).

## Design guidelines

Use the `ToastMessage` component for messages and actions that should be helpful but ultimately ignorable without any impact on what the user wants to get done.

**When to use each variation**

**Toast with a title**

For when you want to just provide a quick process update like a confirmation

**Example scenarios**

<ToastMessage message={"Transaction started"} />

<ToastMessage message={"Connected to dApp"} />

**Toast with a subtitle**

For when you want to provide more value through extra helpful information. Ask yourself when implementing your toast: is there anything else I could tell the user that would be useful?

**Example scenarios**

<ToastMessage
  variant="success"
  message={"Payment sent"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 4.20 ETH remaining"}
/>

<ToastMessage
  variant="processing"
  message={"Transaction pending..."}
  secondaryMessage={"This might take a few minutes"}
/>

<ToastMessage
  variant="failure"
  message={"Transaction failed"}
  secondaryMessage={"You didn't have enough Ether"}
/>

**How it works**

- `ToastMessage` component disappears automatically
- Users can dismiss them manually
- They display one at a time, so if multiple messages are necessary, each one should appear after the previous message.

**Best practices**

**Use for non-critical information**

Don't use toast messages for information that will directly impact the success of completing a task, for example a network failure. They dismiss automatically so things can be missed easily. Note: users are able to dismiss them immediately manually. For critical information, use [`Modal`](/Develop/Modal) to bring that info to the user's attention.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: <ToastMessage message={"Transaction started"} my={3} mr={3} />,
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Switch to Rinkeby to start the transaction"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

**Think about placement**

Toasts should steer clear of navigational elements and important areas of the screen. Consider that the MetaMask browser extension could potentially hide your toast messages.

**Stick to one optional link**

This link should support your update and must be optional. This might be to provide further information (like linking to Etherscan) or something that can affect the process (like cancelling while your payment is in a processing state). Link copy should ideally be verb-led like "Check", "View", "Buy" or "Change".

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction started"}
        secondaryMessage={"Check on its progress at Etherscan"}
        actionText={"Check"}
        actionHref={"#"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Connect to start this transaction"}
        actionText={"Connect"}
        actionHref={"#"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
      />
    )
  }}

## Content

Some best practices for writing `ToastMessages`.

**Keep things short**

Toast messages are only around a short while so keep the copy short to make them readable in the time they're on screen.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: <ToastMessage message={"Transaction started"} my={3} mr={3} />,
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage message={"We've started your transaction"} my={3} mr={3} />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

**Processing messages**

Keep them in the present tense and reference what's being processed to give the user reassurance that what they've initiated is happening. An ellipsis can help indicate that something's happening.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Processing payment..."}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"processing"}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Processing started"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"processing"}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

**Success messages**

Describe what's happened and avoid generic "Success!" messages. Ethereum actions can take a while to it makes sense to remind the user of the action that has succeeded.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"0.4 Ether sent!"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"success"}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage message={"Success!"} my={3} mr={3} variant={"success"} />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

Echo the language the user interacted with to initiate the action in the success message. So if the button copy was "Send Ether":

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage message={"Ether sent"} my={3} mr={3} variant={"success"} />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Ether transferred"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"success"}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

If you explain what's happened you don't need to use terms like "successfully" which will help keep your content shorter

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction confirmed"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"success"}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction confirmed successfully"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"success"}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

**Failure messages**

_Note: it may be preferable to use alternative components like [`Modal`](/components/rimble-ui/Modal) to bring a transaction failure to a user's attention, as they can't be missed and provide more space for explanation._

Where possible, explain the reason for failure and offer a suggestion of what to do next. And use the action to help the user remedy the situation.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction failed"}
        secondaryMessage={"You didn't have enough Ether"}
        actionText={"Buy ETH"}
        actionHref={"#"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"failure"}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction failed"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"failure"}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

Echo the language the user interacted with to initiate the action in the failure message. So if the button copy was "Pay 0.13 Ether":

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Payment failed"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"failure"}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <ToastMessage
        message={"Transaction failed"}
        my={3}
        mr={3}
        variant={"failure"}
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>
