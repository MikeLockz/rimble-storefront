import { ToastMessage, Button } from "rimble-ui";

Use toast messages to provide updates about a process. The `ToastMessage` component extends [Box](/components/rimble-ui/Box).

*Want to find out about the provider?* Read [ToastMessage.provider documentation](/components/rimble-ui/ToastMessageProvider)

**Import component**

```
import { ToastMessage } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Examples

Different ways to use the `ToastMessage` component.

**Standard toast**

For when you want to just provide a quick process update like a confirmation.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"Transaction started"} />
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"0xAc0...e5A connected"} colorTheme={"dark"} my={3} />
```

**Standard toast with subtitle**

For when you want to provide more value through extra helpful information. Ask yourself when implementing your toast: is there anything else I could tell the user that would be useful?

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Transaction complete"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 4.20 ETH remaining"}
  my={3}
/>
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Switched network"}
  secondaryMessage={"You are now on Rinkeby"}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
  my={3}
/>
```

**Icon**

When you want to reinforce your message with a visual.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage message={"Welcome to my dapp"} icon={"Mood"} my={3} />
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Welcome to my dapp"}
  icon={"Mood"}
  my={3}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
/>
```

**Link**

When your Toast message has a link to support it. Note: this link should only take users to optional, supporting info.

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Transaction started"}
  secondaryMessage={"Check on its progress using Etherscan"}
  my={3}
  actionText={"Check"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
/>
```

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage
  message={"Write update here [Required]"}
  secondaryMessage={"Supporting information for update [Optional]"}
  icon={"InfoOutline"}
  my={3}
  actionText={"Link"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
  colorTheme={"dark"}
/>
```

**Process toasts**

---

Ready-made messages to help users understand what's happening with a process they initiate, like a transaction.

<Flash my={3} variant="info">
  <Flex alignItems="baseline">
    <Icon name="Info" size="16px" mr={3}/>
    <Text>
      Because they disappear, process toasts should be supported by other persistent UI elements so that a user can see the status of their transaction. Alternatively a ToastMessage is a safe bet if your dApp uses a sidechain or some other method of completing transactions in less than a minute.
    </Text>
  </Flex>
</Flash>

**Processing**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Processing my={3} message={"Processing 0.00018 ETH payment"} />
```

**Success**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Success
  my={3}
  message={"ETH sent"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 1.03 Ether (ETH) remaining"}
/>
```

**Failure**

```js is=react-live
<ToastMessage.Failure
  my={3}
  message={"Payment failed"}
  secondaryMessage={"You don't have enough Ether (ETH)"}
  actionText={"Buy ETH"}
  actionHref={"#!"}
/>
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

## Design guidelines

Use the `ToastMessage` component for messages and actions that should be helpful but ultimately ignorable without any impact on what the user wants to get done.

### When to use

**Toast with a title**

For when you want to just provide a quick process update like a confirmation

**Example scenarios**

<ToastMessage mb={3} message={"Transaction started"} />

<ToastMessage mb={3} message={"Connected to dapp"} />

**Toast with a subtitle**

For when you want to provide more value through extra helpful information. Ask yourself when implementing your toast: is there anything else I could tell the user that would be useful?

### Example scenarios

<ToastMessage
  variant="success"
  message={"Payment sent"}
  secondaryMessage={"You have 4.20 ETH remaining"}
  mb={3}
/>

<ToastMessage
  variant="processing"
  message={"Transaction pending..."}
  secondaryMessage={"This might take a few minutes"}
  mb={3}
/>

<ToastMessage
  variant="failure"
  message={"Transaction failed"}
  secondaryMessage={"You didn't have enough Ether"}
  mb={3}
/>

### How it works

- `ToastMessage` component disappears automatically
- Users can dismiss them manually
- They display one at a time, so if multiple messages are necessary, each one should appear after the previous message.

### Best practices

**Think about placement**

Toasts should steer clear of navigational elements and important areas of the screen. Consider that the MetaMask browser extension could potentially hide your toast messages.

**Use for non-critical information**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Only use Toast messages for missable information that doesn't require a user's attention or acknowledgement.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction started"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Don't use Toast messages for critical information that directly impacts the success of completing a task. They dismiss automatically so information can be missed.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Switch to Rinkeby to start the transaction"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

For critical information, use [Modal](/components/rimble-ui/Modal) to bring that info to the user's attention.

**Stick to one optional link**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "The link should support your update and must be optional. This might be to provide further information (like linking to Etherscan).",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction started"}
          secondaryMessage={"Check on its progress at Etherscan"}
          actionText={"Check"}
          actionHref={"#"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Links must be optional and not critical to proceeding with/completing a user's task.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Connect to start this transaction"}
          actionText={"Connect"}
          actionHref={"#"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

## Content

Some best practices for writing `ToastMessages`.

**Keep things short**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Keep the copy short, yet meaningful, to make it readable in the time the Toast is visible. If you can't shorten it consider other UI.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction started"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Longer copy is harder to read in the time before the ToastMessage disappears.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"We've started your transaction"}
          mt={3}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

**Processing messages**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Keep them in the present tense and reference what's being processed to give the user reassurance that what they've initiated is happening. An ellipsis can help indicate that something's happening.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Processing payment..."}
          mt={3}
          variant={"processing"}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Using the past tense to describe something that is happening can be less clear when read at a glance.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Processing started"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"processing"}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

**Success messages**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Describe what's happened. Ethereum actions can take a while to it makes sense to remind the user of the action that has succeeded.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"0.4 Ether sent!"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Avoid generic 'Success!' messages. Vague comments are less helpful than ones that reference the task at hand.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Success!"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Echo the language the user interacted with to initiate the action in the success message. So if the button copy was 'Send Ether':",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Ether sent"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "If the action was labelled as 'Sending Ether', don't switch up the vocabulary. Consistency creates less confusion.",
      code: (

          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Remove terms like 'successfully' – they don't add anything if your message explains what's happened.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction confirmed"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}

    negative: {
      caption: "'Successfully' makes your message longer unnecessarily.",

          message={"Transaction confirmed successfully"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"success"}

</DoDont>

**Failure messages**

<Flash my={3} variant="info">
  <Flex alignItems="baseline">
    <Icon name="Info" size="16px" mr={3}/>
    <Text>
      Note: it may be preferable to use alternative components like <Link color="inherit" href="/components/rimble-ui/Modal" title="To Modal component" target="_blank">Modal</Link> to bring a transaction failure to a user's attention, as they can't be missed and provide more space for explanation.
    </Text>
  </Flex>
</Flash>

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Explain the reason for failure, offer a suggestion of what to do next and use the action to help the user remedy the situation.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction failed"}
          secondaryMessage={"You didn't have enough Ether"}
          actionText={"Buy ETH"}
          actionHref={"#"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"failure"}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "Don't just tell a user something has failed without providing a suggestion of what to do next.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction failed"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"failure"}
        />
      )
    }
  }}
</DoDont>



<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: {
      caption: "Echo the language the user interacted with to initiate the action in the failure message. So if the button copy was 'Pay 0.13 Ether':",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Payment failed"}
          mt={3}
          variant={"failure"}
        />
      )
    },
    negative: {
      caption: "If the action was labelled as 'Paying Ether', don't switch up the vocabulary. Consistency creates less confusion.",
      code: (
        <ToastMessage
          message={"Transaction failed"}
