Use the `QR` component to renders a QR code for a provided string. Can be used as a shortcut to input a public Ethereum address or link to a specific website.

**Import component**

```
import { QR } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Example

```js is=react-live
<QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
```

**Setting custom size by pixels**

```js is=react-live
<QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" size={40} />
```

**Setting custom size by percent**

```js is=react-live
<QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" size={"100%"} />
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

The `QR` component is utilizing [react.qrcode](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcode.react) to generate the QR code from the _value_ prop.

## Design guidelines

Some best practice for using `QR` in your product.

**Explain what it is**

Let your user know what the QR code represents and what will happen once they scan the QR code. Don't just assume your user is familiar with the pattern of QR codes being used for public addresses.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Box>
        <Heading.h5>Your connected account:</Heading.h5>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
      </Box>
    ),
    negative: (
      <Box textAlign={"center"}>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
      </Box>
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

**Provide an alternative**

If you're using a QR code to represent a public address, always give the user the ability to copy/paste the address manually too. They may not want to grant your dapp access to their camera or they may be at a desktop set-up where scanning QR codes is inconvenient.

      <Box>
        <Heading.h5>Your connected account:</Heading.h5>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
        <EthAddress address="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
      </Box>
    ),
    negative: (
      <Box textAlign={"center"}>
        <Heading.h5>Your connected account</Heading.h5>
        <QR value="0xAc03BB73b6a9e108530AFf4Df5077c2B3D481e5A" />
      </Box>
    )
  }}
</DoDont>
