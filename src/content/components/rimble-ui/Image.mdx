# Image

Use the `Image` component to display an image in your product. This renders the `<img>` HTML element and extends the [`Box`](/components/rimble-ui/Box) component.

**Import component**

```lang=jsx
import { Image } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Example

```js is=react-live
<Image
  alt="random unsplash image"
  borderRadius={8}
  height="auto"
  src="https://source.unsplash.com/random/1280x720"
/>
```

## Accessibility

- Always include an alt prop so that screen readers can describe the image to those with visual impairments
