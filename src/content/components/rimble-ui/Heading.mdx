# Heading

Use the `Heading` component to give users scannable titles on your interface. A user should be able to understand what a page is for just by reading the headings. This components extends the [`Text`](/ui-components/Text) component to provide default heading styles for H1-H6.

**Import component**

```lang=jsx
import { Heading } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Examples

Different ways to use the `Heading` component.

**h1**

Use for page or screen titles.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h1>Transactions</Heading.h1>
```

**h2**

Use for headings that are sub-sections of the h1 heading.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h2>Latest transaction</Heading.h2>
```

**h3**

Use for headings that are sub-sections of an h2 heading.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h3>Successful transactions</Heading.h3>
```

**h4**

Use for headings that are sub-sections of any h3 headings.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h4>Transaction fees</Heading.h4>
```

**h5**

Use for headings that are sub-sections of any h4 headings.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h5>Transaction fees explained</Heading.h5>
```

**h6**

Use for headings that are sub-sections of any h5 headings.

```js is=react-live
<Heading.h6>How are transaction fees calculated?</Heading.h6>
```

## Design guidelines

Some best practices for using `Heading` in your product.

- Only use one `h1` per page
- Headings should explain the content below
- Keep headings short for scannability
- Headings should appear at the top of the section of the interface they're introducing

## Content

Some best practices for writing `Heading` components.

**Avoid articles to keep headings succinct**

Don’t use articles (a, the, an) in headings. This will make them shorter and quicker to scan.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: <Heading.h2>Add wallet</Heading.h2>,
    negative: <Heading.h2>Add a wallet</Heading.h2>
  }}
</DoDont>
