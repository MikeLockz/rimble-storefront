The `Text` component allows you to control font size, weight, alignment and colour.

**Import component**

```
import { Text } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Examples

Different ways to use the `Text` component.

**Default**

By default, the Text component will render text inside a `<div>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Text with span**

Renders text inside a `<span>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text.span>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text.span>
```

**Paragraph text**

Renders text inside a `<p>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text.p>The intent of Ethereum is to ...</Text.p>
```

**Text with strikethrough**

```js is=react-live
<Text.s>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text.s>
```

**Bold text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontWeight={"bold"}>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Italic text**

```js is=react-live
<Text italic>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Caps text**

```js is=react-live
<Text caps>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Serif text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontFamily="serif">The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Sans serif text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontFamily="sansSerif">The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

** Styled System Props **

`Text` uses `COMMON`, `TYPOGRAHY` groups of [Styed System props](/components/rimble-ui/system-props).

## Design guidelines

Use the Text component for copy. Remember to keep your writing as simple as possible, particularly in the blockchain world. Also, bear in mind users are prone to scanning content, so use small chunks of text broken up by headings to make your text more useful.

**Don't center-align your text if it's over 3 lines**
