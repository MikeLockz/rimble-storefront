The `Text` component allows you to control font size, weight, alignment and colour.

**Import component**

```
import { Text } from 'rimble-ui';
```

## Examples

Different ways to use the `Text` component.

**Default**

By default, the Text component will render text inside a `<div>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Text with span**

Renders text inside a `<span>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text.span>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text.span>
```

**Paragraph text**

Renders text inside a `<p>` element.

```js is=react-live
<Text.p>The intent of Ethereum is to ...</Text.p>
```

**Text with strikethrough**

```js is=react-live
<Text.s>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text.s>
```

**Bold text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontWeight={"bold"}>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Italic text**

```js is=react-live
<Text italic>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Caps text**

```js is=react-live
<Text caps>The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Serif text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontFamily="serif">The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

**Sans serif text**

```js is=react-live
<Text fontFamily="sansSerif">The intent of Ethereum is to...</Text>
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

** Styled System Props **

`Text` uses `COMMON`, `TYPOGRAHY` groups of [Styed System props](/components/rimble-ui/system-props).

## Design guidelines

Use the Text component for copy. Remember to keep your writing as simple as possible, particularly in the blockchain world. Also, bear in mind users are prone to scanning content, so use small chunks of text broken up by headings to make your text more useful.

[Content guidelines evidence](https://readabilityguidelines.myxwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/User%20centred%20design/How%20people%20read/)

**Don't center-align your text if it's over 3 lines**

Centre-aligned text can make it more difficult to read.

**Use `Heading` to break up long copy**

Use the [Heading](/components/rimble-ui/Heading) component to break up text and make it easier for users to find what they're looking for.

          Ethereum is particularly important for building decentralized
          applications with particular emphasis on rapid development time,
          security for small and rarely used applications, and the ability of
          different applications to very efficiently interact, are important.

**Aim for a low reading age**

Make it easier for your users to read your copy. The lower the reading age, the simpler it will be for them to consume your information. [Hemingway app](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) makes it easier to simplify your writing.
