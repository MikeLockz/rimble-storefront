The Blockie component allows for use of [Ethereum blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies) in your app. Blockies are identicons for Ethereum addresses. They are not meant to replace user profiles. Instead, they allow users to check if an address they want to interact with is the correct one.

**Import component**

```jsx
import { Blockie } from "rimble-ui";
```

## Example

```js is=react-live
<Blockie
  opts={{
    seed: "foo",
    color: "#dfe",
    bgcolor: "#a71",
    size: 15,
    scale: 3,
    spotcolor: "#000"
  }}
/>
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

## Design guidelines

Some best practice for using `Blockie` in your product.

**Don't make blockies circular**

This obscures some of the blockie, making it more difficult for users to visually identify their Ethereum address. This means they're not a good idea to use in place of avatars.

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Blockie
        opts={{
          seed: "foo",
          color: "#dfe",
          bgcolor: "#a71",
          size: 15,
          scale: 3,
          spotcolor: "#000"
        }}
      />
    ),
    negative: (
      <Avatar
        mb={3}
        size="medium"
        src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*6E2bK3gagTUHroxhDsDP1w.jpeg"
      />
    )
  }}
</DoDont>

## Research

We have some anecdotal evidence that blockies are not effectively helping users of Ethereum wallets or dApps as they are being implemented in many cases. We have chosen to include the pattern in Rimble because of its broad adoption and lack of alternatives. However, we believe further research, better usage guidelines, and potentially alternative patterns are needed.
