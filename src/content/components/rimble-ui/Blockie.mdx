The Blockie component allows for use of Ethereum blockies in your app. Blockies are identicons for Ethereum addresses. They are not meant to replace user profiles. Instead, they allow users to check if an address they want to interact with is the correct one. [Ethereum blockies](https://github.com/ethereum/blockies "More information about Ethereum blockies")

**Import component**

```jsx
import { Blockie } from "rimble-ui";
```

## Example

```js is=react-live
<Blockie
  opts={{
    seed: "foo",
    color: "#dfe",
    bgcolor: "#a71",
    size: 15,
    scale: 3,
    spotcolor: "#000"
  }}
/>
```

## Props

<PropsTable propMetaData={props.propMetaData} />

## Design guidelines

Some best practice for using `Blockie` in your product.

**Don't make blockies circular**

<DoDont>
  {{
    positive: (
      <Box>
        <Blockie
          opts={{
            seed: "foo",
            color: "#dfe",
            bgcolor: "#a71",
            size: 15,
            scale: 3,
            spotcolor: "#000"
          }}
        />
        <Text
          fontSize={1}
          mt={3}
        >
          Keep Blockies square so users have the most detail possible to identify their Ethereum address.
        </Text>
      </Box>
    ),
    negative: (
      <Box>
        <Avatar

        />
        <Text fontSize={1}>
          Adding borderRadius makes it more difficult for users to visually identify their Ethereum address.

  }}

## Research

We have some anecdotal evidence that blockies are not effectively helping users of Ethereum wallets or dApps as they are being implemented in many cases. We have chosen to include the pattern in Rimble because of its broad adoption and lack of alternatives. However, we believe further research, better usage guidelines, and potentially alternative patterns are needed.
