In-depth pieces on designing patterns and workflows that help your users navigate Ethereum

## Connecting to a dapp

**A well-designed connection flow will guide users through the process, prepare them for being connected and let them know about some fundamental blockchain concepts. It needs to be swift and simple for those who know what they're doing but informative and instructional for those new to blockchain.**

We've written a guide that covers the process of connecting on a desktop via the MetaMask extension or on a mobile via a mobile wallet browser. We'll be looking into other methods of connecting like hardware wallets and developing technologies like WalletConnect in the future. Let us know if you have any existing insight on other ways to connect.

## Designing transaction states

**Transactions are a minefield. They're slow, irreversible and need ETH. Plus it's hard to explain why without going into too much technical detail. And because of all the above, it's really easy to make transactions complicated and confusing.**

We've been doing some design exploration and testing to try and figure out what works well for most users. This guide will pass on the lessons we've learned and give you some practical tips to try yourself.
