In-depth pieces on designing patterns and workflows that help your users navigate Ethereum

## Connecting to a dapp

**A well-designed connection flow will guide users through the process, prepare them for being connected and let them know about some fundamental blockchain concepts. It needs to be swift and simple for those who know what they're doing but informative and instructional for those new to blockchain.**

We've written a guide that covers the process of connecting on a desktop via the MetaMask extension or on a mobile via a mobile wallet browser.

## DevCon V Demo

**We gave a talk about the State of Transaction States at DevCon V in Osaka.**

We did a deep-dive on best practices for informing users on how they should move a user through performing a transaction. This includes checking for balance, handling multiple transactions, giving gas estimates, and providing total transaction time estimate. The [source code for the dapp](https://github.com/ConsenSys/rimble-devcon-2019) is also open source so you can see how it was all done.
