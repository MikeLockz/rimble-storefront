This guide outlines some principles for designing user-friendly transactions. Our users told us that building effective transaction states was a pain point for them so we've done some design research to try to figure out some do's and don'ts.

## Complexity of transactions

There are a number of reasons they're such a pain point for builders:

- **Irreversibility**: how can you reduce the chance of mistakes?
- **Fees (or "Gas")**: how and when do you explain fees?
- **Technology**: how much of the blockchain should you explain?
- **Time**: how can you communicate progress and explain waits?
- **Education**: will users without knowledge of transaction want to educate themselves?

If you've struggled with any of these questions, this guide is for you.

## Importance of transactions

Transactions are important because they're integral to every dApp. But there are a number of other reasons, rooted in behavioural science, that you may not have thought of.

### The halo effect

> _The "halo effect" is when one trait of a person or thing is used to make an overall judgment of that person or thing. It supports rapid decisions, even if biased ones._<sup>1</sup>

This means a particularly negative experience will bias your user's perception of any future experience. "Wow, that transaction made no sense, I had no idea what was going on. This site must be really poorly done. Is my money ok? I shouldn't do that again."

### The peak-end rule

> _Cognitive biases change the way that we recall past events. The peak–end rule focuses our memories around the most intense moments of an experience and the way an experience ends._<sup>2</sup>

This means that an emotionally intense – positive or negative – point of an experience and the end of that experience are most heavily weighted in our memory. A transaction is usually an intense moment at the end of an experience with your dApp. So this might mean a confusing transaction in an otherwise good dApp could lead to users remembering your dApp as bad.

## Method

After a series of design explorations we designed a prototype that we iterated on between usability tests. We spoke to blockchain experts as well as those who've rarely or never used dApps before. This gave us the data we needed to make the following recommendations.

      experts.

## Don't rely on wallet UX

For the smoothest and simplest experience, any content related to the transaction should be framed around what the user is trying to achieve. Wallet content isn't specific enough to truly help your users through a transaction because they need to cover so many dApp use cases.

    negative: (

## Prevent errors

Users lack confidence transacting. It's a combination of new technology, the risk of losing money and transaction irreversibility. Web2 experiences can be faster and more streamlined because errors often have recovery methods. In Web3 a little friction – like a transaction summary – could go a long way in preventing irreversible errors in the first place. Consider what information a user need to avoid common errors, for example:

- their network
- their address
- their balance

## Set user expectations

Be sure to communicate an estimated time and transaction fee when summarising the transaction. Your user should be aware of how long it will take and how much it will cost before they confirm the transaction in their wallet. This will prevent transaction fees feeling like hidden fees and allow your user to better plan their next steps.

## Just enough feedback

Users only really value certain information when transacting:

1. Has it started?
2. What's its progress?
3. Is it done?

Although it's possible to provide your user with more feedback, this only dilutes the answer to these fundamental questions.

Users also value an indication of progress like a "percentage complete" over UI like a processing spinner. This UI can actually leave some users to question whether their transaction has timed out, increasing the risk of a repeat transaction.

        </ul>
      </Text>
    )
  }}

## Design for next steps

Often, a transaction isn't your user's end goal, so your transaction success state shouldn't be a dead end. Think about what your user is trying to ultimately achieve and help them get closer to that goal. Additionally you can use it to encourage the use of other dApps in the ecosystem. As an example, if a transaction generates DAI, you could suggest the user puts that Dai into a DeFi dApp so the user can start to earn interest.

            Promote other complementary products that will provide extra value
            to your user. They might not be aware of it!
