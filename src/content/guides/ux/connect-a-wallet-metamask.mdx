Having to interact with a third party extension in order to use a web application is already a bizarre experience for most users so you shouldn't assume your user knows what to do. There's a good chance your user is a little confused so clear, instructional language can help them progress.

The connection request and signature request modals will only appear on desktop because in mobile wallet browsers, the wallet interface will handle these requests and obscure your dapp's interface.

In testing we found these modals performed best when they were simple and instructional, focussed just on the task at hand.

## The connection request

            Let them know it won't cost any Ether – to them it's a blockchain

  }}
</DoDont>

## Help them sign the message

After signing a connection request, the user will be asked to deal with yet another request. If you're not paying attention this can feel like something you've literally just done. So it's important to flag this as something different and demonstrate that this extra step has value: protecting your account. We recommend calling it out as "Verifying" the account you've just connected – in a similar way to how we're used to verifying email addresses in the traditional web.

_"To connect securely, sign the message in your MetaMask extension"_ is the Web3 equivalent of _"To log in securely, click the link we've just emailed you"._

            In addition to all the advice for the connection request, frame this

            is something they need to do to connect. This is especially
            important when a connection request isn't triggered in this flow.

## Write a meaningful message

There's a good chance that some users won't read your dapp messaging around signature requests. With the MetaMask window appearing automatically, their attention will be automatically diverted there. That means you need to include your information there so they're not left confused about another MetaMask window. Be clear about what you're asking them to do now.

## Let them change their mind

Connection is a fairly new concept. There's a chance they could reject either request because of the way something's been worded in MetaMask or they're confused or just because they've made an error. Because connection is so fundamental to using a dapp it's a good idea to include an "Are you sure?" modal. This should reinforce to the user that they need to go through this process to use the blockchain features in your dapp.

Of course you should respect their decision and offer them a way to actually reject the request and go back to browsing as a guest. However to account for confusion or error, you should allow them the ability to trigger the request again if they change their mind. And not have them start from the beginning of the flow.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Reiterate that they can't proceed with connection or use blockchain
            features without accepting or signing the request
          </li>
          <li>
            If possible include an example blockchain feature to provide extra
            context
          </li>
          <li>
            Show you respect their decision and reiterate that they can browse
            your dapp as a guest if they wish
          </li>
          <li>
            Re-trigger your dApps modals that explain the relevant request so
            the user gets the instructions back
          </li>

    negative: (
      <Text>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Use CTA copy like "Connect" or "Sign" – this button will only
            trigger the MetaMask windows to appear again – it won't actually
            accept the connection request or sign the message. Don't make users
            feel like they have to do stuff twice.
          </li>
        </ul>

Ok, so they've connected, accepted and signed. Time to let them know that's all for now.
