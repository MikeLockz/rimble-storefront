title: No MetaMask modal
description: Grab the code for a ready-made modal template to display when a user is trying to connect but doesn't have MetaMask installed
image: "/images/no-metamask-template.png"
---

The modal should instruct users to install MetaMask if they are trying to use a Web3 feature in your dApp but you can't detect a Web3 provider. This should only be displayed if the user is using a desktop browser that is compatible with MetaMask (e.g. not Safari). This modal should explain why the user needs MetaMask and provide a direct link to installation.

<Flash>
  This template is only relevant in edge cases where your dApp doesn't support alternative connection methods like <Link href="https://walletconnect.org/" title="To WalletConnect" target="_blank">WalletConnect</Link> or <Link href="https://portis.io" title="To Portis" target="_blank">Portis</Link>.
